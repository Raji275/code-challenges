# AWS AppSync API Development

## The Challenge

Build an AWS AppSync API which supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

### Requirements

1. All AWS Infrastructure needs to be automated with IAC using Serverless Framework and CloudFormation as needed

2. The AppSync API should store data in DynamoDB

3. The template should be fully working, deployable, and support multi-stage deployments

4. A public GitHub repository must be shared with frequent commits

5. A video should be recorded (www.loom.com) of you talking over the application code, IAC, and any additional areas you want to highlight in your solution to demonstrate additional skills

Please spend only what you consider a reasonable amount of time for this.

## Optionally

Create a frontend with ReactJS or Vue.js which uses the Amplify library to connect to your AppSync API and store the response.
